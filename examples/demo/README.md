# Jazz Vector demo journal app

**A simple demo of Jazz Vector. It acts as a personal journal app that lets you store journal entries.**

It shows off storage & semantic search of high-dimensional vectors:

- local first
- sync across devices
- end-to-end encryption
- full offline support

## Running locally

```bash
pnpm i
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) with your browser to see the result.
